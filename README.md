# iOSDev Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the iOSDev repository! This repository contains all the projects related to iOS development that I have been working on. Each project showcases different aspects and functionalities of iOS development, from basic applications to more complex and feature-rich apps.

## Projects

### 1. Donut Picker App

The Donut Picker App is an iOS application that allows users to select different types of donuts and their quantities, see the total price, and proceed to buy them. The app also has a manager mode where managers can add new products, update stock, and view purchases made during the current session.

### 2. Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock

This project is an extended version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, incorporating two additional gestures: the lizard (represented by a hand shaped like a sock puppet's mouth) and Spock (represented by the Vulcan salute from Star Trek). This variation decreases the likelihood of a tie. The game was invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla and appeared in three episodes of The Big Bang Theory.
