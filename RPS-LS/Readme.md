# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game

## Overview
This project is an extended version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, incorporating two additional gestures: the lizard (represented by a hand shaped like a sock puppet's mouth) and Spock (represented by the Vulcan salute from Star Trek). This variation decreases the likelihood of a tie. The game was invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla and appeared in three episodes of The Big Bang Theory.

## Features
1. **Basic Gameplay**: The game includes the original rock, paper, and scissors gestures, as well as the new lizard and Spock gestures.
2. **Gesture Pairings**: Each gesture beats two of the other gestures and is beaten by the remaining two.
3. **Scoring**: The game keeps track of the number of wins, draws, and losses.
